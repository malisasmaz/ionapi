# TechStack
I use TypeScript and Express.js to create REST API. Mocha and Chai for tests.

1. I used Express js for API operations. It is one of the most starred npm packages and a great option for building APIs :grinning:.

2. I use Mocha and Chai for API test operations. I added tests for each operations.
